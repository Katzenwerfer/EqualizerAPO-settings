# Windows 100% volume hurts my ears (too loud), but I don't want to use the slider below 50% mainly for precision reasons.
# This file fixes that by setting the volume to 50% in dB value
# A stupid solution, but one I like :D

# Similar to the crossfeed one. Some times it works on pre-mix and some times it doesn't
# Leave in post-mix just in case
# Stage: post-mix

# Preamp: -10.3 dB
