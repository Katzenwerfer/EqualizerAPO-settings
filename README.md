# EqualizerAPO-settings
My settings for Equalizer APO 

Most subfiles have everything disabled, so you gotta enable them first

# Peace usage

I use Peace to compensate a bit of hearing loss and other stuff that are relatively easier to do. Other than that I prefer to use vanilla Equalizer APO's GUI.
