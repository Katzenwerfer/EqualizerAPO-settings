# EqualizerAPO-settings
My settings for Equalizer APO 

Most subfiles have everything disabled, so you gotta enable them first
Also, some surround solutions like DTS:X kinda mess with the pre-mix stage, so make sure to change the processing stage to post-mix when using them. 

# Peace usage

I use Peace to compensate a bit of hearing loss and other stuff that are relatively easier to do. Other than that I prefer to use vanilla Equalizer APO's GUI.

# HeSuVi usage

I use HeSuVi in conjunction with HiFi Virtual Cable, ASIO Bridge and ASIO4ALL
